# Photo Appearance Changer

a Desktop application aimed to deploy the StarGAN model. The basic idea of StarGAN is to use 
input Image and the target domain (usually generated randomly, represented by binary or 
one-hot vector) together as the input of the Generator to obtain a fake Image, and then 
take the values of the fake Image and origin domain as the input of the same Generator gets 
a reconstructed image. This enables StarGAN to use one Generator. The task of image-to-image translation is to change a particular aspect of a given image to another, e.g., changing the hair color of a person from Black to Blond.
